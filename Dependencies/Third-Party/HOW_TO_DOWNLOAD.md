## How to download engine dependencies

Its actually quite simple to download the dependencies automatically via CMake.  
Yeah, did I forget to say **you NEED CMake** to use the automated process?  
I suggest you go install it first.  

To run the `DownloadDependencies.cmake` script, just run `cmake -P DownloadDependencies.cmake` and it will download them for you.  

All dependencies are from github, so you can clone them or download them yourself.
